# Server side

* #### Hardware
  * Any system should do, but we highly recommend that the system has **2GB** of **memory**.

* #### Software
  * `PHP` 5.6 or later - `PHP 7` is well tested.
  * [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com) or [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org). Actually, any DBMS supported by Laravel should work.
  * [NginX](https://www.nginx.com) or [Apache](http://www.apache.org)
  * [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org), Version 6.*.* is preferable.
  * [Composer](https://getcomposer.org)

# Client side

* [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) for playing `FLAC`.
