# Mobile Support and Limitation

The client component of Koel has a responsive GUI that displays fairly well on a mobile device. Certain functionalities are not available, however, some due to technology limitation, some my incompetence. For instance:
* Shortcut keys don’t work (duh)
* ~Seeking doesn’t work~
* Equalizer may not work
* Volume must be controlled from a system level
* ~Next songs can’t be played automatically if the browser is minimized, or if the device is locked~
  Update: On iOS, Google Chrome can still play next songs even if the device is locked, as long as the browser remains maximized.
* On iOS, next and previous songs can’t be controlled from Control Center or lock screen
If you know how to fix these issues and enhance Koel’s experience, read on.
