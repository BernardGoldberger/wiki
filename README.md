## Credits

Koel is built on the shoulder of the giants. My sincere thanks go to:

* Evan You for the awesome Vue
* Taylor Otwell and Graham Campbell for their work on the rock solid Laravel
* Jeffrey Way for Laravel Elixir and the amazing Vue series on Laracasts
* The authors of all JavaScript and PHP packages used in the project – I’ve literally got the best of both worlds.
